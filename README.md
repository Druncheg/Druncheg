- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew. I`m a SkillFactory student mastering manual software testing.
- 👀 I’m interested in performing tests on software to find any bugs or irregularities in the way the software operates.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various testing techniques, how to create test plans, test cases, check lists, bug reports, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner projects just to give a start to my tester career.
